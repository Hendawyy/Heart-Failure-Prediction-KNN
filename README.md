# Heart Failure Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains Python code for predicting heart failure using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The code includes data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv," which contains various clinical features related to heart health.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you'll need the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using `pip`:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Usage

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hendawyy/Heart-Failure-Prediction-KNN.git
```

### Results

The code includes the determination of the optimal value of K for the KNN algorithm, confusion matrix analysis, classification report, accuracy score, precision score, recall score, and F1 score.
